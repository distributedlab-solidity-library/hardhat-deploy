# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic use case of [Hardhat migrate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dlsl/hardhat-migrate) plugin. 

It comes with a sample contract and an external library, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat deploy --network localhost
```
